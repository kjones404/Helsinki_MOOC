# Exercise 10: Calculating the circumference

The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula `2 * pi * radius`. Create a program that asks the user for the radius and then calculates the circumference using the given radius. Java already contains the value of pi in the `Math.PI` variable, which you can use in your calculation.

```
Type the radius: 20

Circumference of the circle: 125.66370614359172
```
