# Exercise 14: A positive number

Create a program that asks the user for a number and tells if the number is positive (i.e. greater than zero).

```
Type a number: 5

The number is positive.
```

```
Type a number: -2

The number is not positive.
```

__Are you certain that your code is indented correctly?__

Reread the section on [code indentation](https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part1/week-1/#indentation). Observe what happens when you press shift, alt and f simultaneously! The same automatic indentation functionality can also be used using the menu bar by selecting Source and then Format.
