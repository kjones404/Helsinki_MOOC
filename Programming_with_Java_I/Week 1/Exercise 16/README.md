# Exercise 16: Even or odd?
Create a program that asks the user for a number and tells whether the number is even or odd.

```
Type a number: 2
Number 2 is even.
```

```
Type a number: 7
Number 7 is odd.
```

__Hint:__ The number's remainder when dividing by 2 tells whether the number is even or odd. The remainder can be obtained with the `%` operator.
