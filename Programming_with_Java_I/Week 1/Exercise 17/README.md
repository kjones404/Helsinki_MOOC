# Exercise 17: Greater number

Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints the greater of those two. The program should also handle the case in which the two numbers are equal.

Example outputs:

```
Type the first number: 5
Type the second number: 3

Greater number: 5
```

```
Type the first number: 5
Type the second number: 8

Greater number: 8
```

```
Type the first number: 5
Type the second number: 5

The numbers are equal!
```
