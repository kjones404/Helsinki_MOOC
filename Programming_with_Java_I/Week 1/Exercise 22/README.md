# Exercise 22: Password

In this exercise we create a program that asks the user for a password. If the password is right, a secret message is shown to the user.

```
Type the password: turnip
Wrong!
Type the password: beetroot
Wrong!
Type the password: carrot
Right!

The secret is: jryy qbar!
```

The program will be done in three steps.

__Exercise 22.1: Asking for the password__

The initial exercise template defines the variable `String password` with a value of `carrot`. Do not change this password! You should make the program ask the user to enter a password and then compare it with the value in the variable `password`. Remember what that there is a special way to compare strings!

```
Type the password: turnip
Wrong!
```

```
Type the password: carrot
Right!
```

```
Type the password: potato
Wrong!
```
