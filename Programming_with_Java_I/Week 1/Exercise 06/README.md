# Exercise 6: Addition

Create a program to calculate the sum of two numbers. At the beginning of the program two variables are introduced and those variables hold the numbers to be summed. Feel free to use other variables if you need to.

For example, if the variables hold numbers 5 and 4, the program should output:

```
5 + 4 = 9
```

If the variables hold numbers 73457 and 12888, the program output should be:

```
73457 + 12888 = 86345
```
