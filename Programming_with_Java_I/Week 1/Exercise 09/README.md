# Exercise 9: Divider

Create a program that asks the user for two integers and prints their quotient. Make sure that `3 / 2 = 1.5`. If the decimal part is missing, take another look at [6.1 Floating point numbers (decimal numbers)](https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part1/week-1/%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D) to find the solution.

```
Type a number: 3
Type another number: 2

Division: 3 / 2 = 1.5
```
